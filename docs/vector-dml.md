# Vector DML

This page outlines the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for vectors in a database.

## Create and Insert a Vector into a Table

To insert vectors into a table:

```sql
INSERT INTO items (
  embedding
)
VALUES
  ('[1,2,3]'),
  ('[4,5,6]');
```

## Read Vectors

To retrieve vectors from the table:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM items
LIMIT 5;
```

### Read Nearest Neighbor Vectors

You can retrieve the nearest neighbors
using either vector distance operators or functions.

Using a distance operator:

```sql
SELECT * FROM items
ORDER BY embedding <-> '[3,1,2]'
LIMIT 5;
```

Using a distance function:

```sql
SELECT name FROM items
ORDER BY l2_distance(embedding, '[3, 1, 2]')
LIMIT 5;
```

Both of the above queries are equivalent.

- If no vector index is present, the "exact nearest neighbor" algorithm is applied.
- If a vector index exists, it will be used automatically.

Note on Multiple Vector Indices
You can create multiple indices for a single vector column,
but each index must correspond to a different type of distance operator.
A single vector column can only have one index for each distance type.

## Control Vector Index Usage

- `/*+ VECTOR_INDEX_SCAN (my_col_name) */`: force vector index
- `/*+ NO_VECTOR_INDEX_SCAN */`: force prevent vector index

### Force the usage of vector index, if present

First, you need to create an ANN vector index on 'embedding' column of table 'items'.

Refer to [Vector Index](./vector-index.md) page.

You can place a hint to force the optimizer to use the vector index if present.
If no index is found, the optimizer silently ignores the hint.

```sql
SELECT /*+ VECTOR_INDEX_SCAN (my_col_name) */ name
FROM items
ORDER BY l2_distance(embedding, '[3, 1, 2]')
LIMIT 5;
```

### Abort the usage of vector index

```sql
SELECT /*+ NO_VECTOR_INDEX_SCAN */ name
FROM items
ORDER BY l2_distance(embedding, '[3, 1, 2]')
LIMIT 5;
```

## Update vector

```sql
UPDATE items
SET embedding = '[1, 2, 3]'
WHERE id = 1;
```

## Delete vector

```sql
DELETE FROM items
WHERE id = 1;
```
