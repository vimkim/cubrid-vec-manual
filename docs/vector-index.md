# Vector Index

This page outlines the CRUD operations for vector indices in CUBRID database.

CUBRID only supports HNSW index at the moment.

## Create a Vector Index

In order to create a vector index, one must specify:

1. the table and the column name where the index will be created onto,
2. the metric function used for distance calculation,
3. the index construction parameters
   (for HNSW, this will be `ef_construction` and `M`).

In order to effectively use the HNSW index, one must specify:

- the search parameter (for HNSW, this will be `ef_search`).

### BNF

```bnf
<create_vector_index> ::= "CREATE VECTOR INDEX" <index_name>
"ON" <table_name> "(" <column_name> <metric_function> ")" <with_options>

<index_name> ::= <identifier>
<table_name> ::= <identifier>
<column_name> ::= <identifier>

<metric_function> ::= <cosine>

<cosine> ::= "cosine"

<with_options> ::= "WITH" "(" <option_list> ")"

<option_list> ::= <option> | <option> "," <option_list>
<option> ::= <parameter> "=" <value>

<parameter> ::= "m" | "ef_construction"
<value> ::= <integer>

<identifier> ::= [A-Za-z_][A-Za-z_0-9]*
<integer> ::= [0-9]+

```

- `m` is the maximum number of connections (edges) each node (vector)
  can have in the graph at each layer of the HNSW structure.
  It is also known as the degree of each node in the graph.
- `ef_construction` controls the size of the dynamic candidate list
  when inserting elements during the index construction phase.
  It defines how many neighbors are checked
  during the construction of the graph when new vectors are added.

### Examples

```sql
CREATE VECTOR INDEX embedding_hnsw_idx
ON items (embedding cosine)
WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 64);
```

## Inspect Vector Index Options

```sql
SELECT embedding_hnsw_idx
FROM items;
```

## Configure Search parameter

- `ef_search` is the exploration factor during search.
  It is a parameter in the HNSW algorithm that controls
  the number of nearest neighbor candidates to explore during a search query.
  If ef_search is not specified,
  it is set to the same value as the `ef_construction` of the index by default.

- [ ] TODO: Discuss the default value of ef_search if not specified.

```sql
SELECT /*+ VECTOR_INDEX_SCAN (embedding) */ name
FROM items
ORDER BY l2_distance(embedding, '[3, 1, 2]')
LIMIT 5
WITH (ef_search = 64);
```

## Update Vector Index

Not implemented yet.

## Delete Vector Index

```sql
DROP INDEX embedding_hnsw_idx;
```
